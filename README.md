# twitter_uchicago_workshop

First, download this repo either through `git clone` or by clicking the `Clone or download` button and selecting `Download zip`. Place the `twitter_uchicago_workshop` folder somewhere easy for you to access. We will be working with the `notebook.ipynb` file.

## Jupyter Installation

We are assuming you have some sort of python set up on your own personal computer. If not, you should go here and download anaconda:

https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

This will give you access to jupyter notebooks. After walking through the installation (you will not need pycharm for this workshop), find `anaconda navigator` and open it. Launch `jupyter notebook` and your internet browser should open. Find the `notebook.ipynb` file in the `twitter_uchicago_workshop` folder and click the file name to open it. You are now all setup!
